# highly generic video games

"Highly generic video games" is a phrase that sounded right — a word mash-up that works as a jumping-off point more than a manifesto.

But there's something real in it: minimalism. Strip a game down to its most generic form and you get the essence — a paddle, a ball, a ship, some rocks. No storylines, no progression systems, no unlockables. Just the core mechanic.

The same impulse shows up elsewhere (a highly generic cellular automata simulator, for instance). Take a concept, remove everything that isn't essential, see what's left.

This repo is a collection of those distillations, running in a browser with no build step.
